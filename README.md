# Retinal-fluid-segmentation
Segmentation algorithms of retinal fluid. The project uses three methods.
## 0_threshold
Based-threshold method for edema segmentation.
## 1_FCM
Based fuzzy c means algorithm for edema segmentation.
## 2_DeepLearning
Based deep learning for edema segmentation. The project mainly includes the commonly used semantic segmentation networks: FCN, SegNet, Unet, and 3D-Unet.
## 3_display_volume
The project calculates edema volume, and shows the edema shape.
